    <h1>A Letter I Needed to Say</h1>
    <p>
Hey,

If you ever feel alone
like no one gets it,
like your thoughts are too loud
and the world’s just too quiet in all the wrong ways.
I hope you remember this:
you were never invisible to me.
Not once.

I saw you.
In all your tired strength,
your soft chaos,
the way you laughed at the dumbest jokes
just to keep the heaviness from settling too deep.
I saw how hard you tried
even when no one noticed.
Especially then.

And I still see you.
Even now,
even from a distance.

I know you don’t always say what’s on your mind.
I know you lock things up to keep from being “too much.”
But you never were.
Not to me.
You were exactly enough even when you didn’t believe it.
Even when your voice trembled.

So if the nights feel long,
if your chest feels heavy,
if it starts to feel like nobody would notice if you disappeared
just know:
I would.
I always would.
Because some part of me still breathes differently
when I think of you.

You’re not alone.
Not really.
Even if I’m not the one holding you right now,
I’m still here.
quietly,
steadily,
loving you in ways that don’t need permission.

Take care of your heart.
It’s been through so much,
but it’s still beating.
And someone still sees the beauty in that.
    </p>
