    <h1>In Case You Do Decide to Go</h1>
    <p>
Hey,
All of this 
you, being here again…  
It felt unreal.  
Like something out of a dream I never thought would return.  
You came back into my life like a whisper from the past,  
and for a while, everything felt softer, warmer
like the universe had pressed rewind just to give me another chance with you.

There were days I’d look at your name on my screen and just pause.  
Because part of me was still trying to believe it.  
That you the one who meant so much back then  
were here again.  
Talking to me, laughing a little, sharing parts of yourself I never stopped missing.

It felt like a piece of my soul had wandered home.

And maybe I didn’t say it enough,  
or maybe I said it too often in all the wrong ways,  
but you matter to me.  
Not in some shallow, passing way 
in that deep, aching kind of way where everything feels tied to your presence.

I care about you.  
I care when you’re quiet, when you’re distant, when you’re hurting.  
I care when you don’t feel like yourself,  
when your moods shift like sudden storms,  
when you don’t have the energy to explain.  
I care when you forget to care for yourself 
because I never forget to care for you.

You’re not just someone I “talked to again.”  
You’re someone I felt again.  
And I’m so grateful for every second of it.

That’s why this isn’t a plea.  
It’s not a trap.  
It’s just something I needed to say in case you’re already halfway gone.

If you choose to leave 
if your heart tells you it’s time to go 
then I’ll let you.  
Because love doesn’t beg.  
Not real love.  
It stays open.  
It hopes.  
And it says goodbye gently, if it must.

Just know this:  
You were loved here.  
You were seen, held, and remembered.  
You were never “just someone” to me.  
And if you go, I’ll carry your name with the quiet kind of reverence  
people save for stars they can’t touch anymore.

Thank you for coming back.  
Even if it was only for a while.  
It meant the world to me.
    </p>
