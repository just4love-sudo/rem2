    <h1>You Are Loved</h1>
    <p>
I don’t know if you’re trying to stay.
Some days it feels like you are 
like there’s a version of you still reaching out,
even if it’s quiet, even if it hurts.
And other days…
it feels like I’m watching you slip through spaces I can’t reach.

I’m not writing this to pull you back.
I’m writing this because I care and I still care,
even when it feels like I’m the only one who does right now.

I’ve seen how your moods swing without warning.
How some days you want everything, and the next,
you want out.
How your laughter can flip into silence in seconds.
How you disappear not because you’re careless
but because your own mind can be too loud to live in.

And I’m not angry.
Not confused, even.
Just… aching.
Because I know the version of you that loves deeply exists.
And I’ve seen her in tiny, tired flashes.
Even if she’s been quiet lately.

I know you’re struggling.
Not just with your body, or food,
but with your thoughts,
your mood,
your whole sense of self.
I know how hard it must be to feel like you’re constantly shifting.
To wake up and not know which version of yourself will show up.

And even through all of it
I don’t see you as a burden.
Not even close.
I see someone who is hurting,
but still worth loving.

I’m not here to fix you.
And I won’t beg you to stay if you’ve already made up your mind.
But I need you to know:
you mattered here.
You still do.
Even if you let go.
Even if you walk away.

I’ll probably still think about you every day.
Still wonder if you’re eating,
if you’re okay,
if you’re safe.
Still hope, in some small corner of me,
that you’ll come back when you’re ready
not because I need you to,
but because you deserve to be loved without fear.

And I’ll always mean it
even if you never hear this again:
You are loved.
Exactly as you are,
even when you can’t stay long enough to believe it.
