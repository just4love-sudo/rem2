Hey,

I know you're not gone.
Not completely.
You're just... taking space, breathing differently, maybe figuring things out.
But if I’m being honest —
it doesn’t feel like a break.
It feels like a slow unraveling.

Like something’s slipping through my fingers and I can’t stop it.
Like every quiet day stretches into a kind of silence I don’t know how to live with.
I keep telling myself you’ll come back,
that this is just temporary,
but some part of me is bracing for the moment it’s not.

And I don’t blame you.
God, I don’t.
You’ve been through so much —
maybe you need time, peace, air.
I just wish I knew what this distance really means.
Because it hurts, not knowing what we are anymore.

I still care.
More than I can say without sounding like I’m begging for something.
And I’m not.
I’m not here to ask you to come back before you’re ready.
I just… I miss you.
Even the tired, quiet version of you.
Even the you that barely says a word.

Maybe you don’t feel the break the same way I do.
Or maybe you do — and that’s why it’s so quiet.

Either way, if you ever wonder whether someone was willing to stay through the silence,
whether someone loved you enough to hold space while you found your way...

The answer is yes.
I still do.
Even if we’re falling apart quietly.

Take care of yourself.
I’ll be here.
