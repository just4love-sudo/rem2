    <h1>A Letter I Never Sent</h1>

    <p>Hey,</p>

    <p>I know you're not gone.  
    Not completely.  
    You're just... taking space, breathing differently, maybe figuring things out.  
    But if I’m being honest   
    it doesn’t feel like a break.  
    It feels like a slow unraveling.</p>

    <p>Like something’s slipping through my fingers and I can’t stop it.  
    Like every quiet day stretches into a kind of silence I don’t know how to live with.  
    I keep telling myself you’ll come back,  
    that this is just temporary,  
    but some part of me is bracing for the moment it’s not.</p>

    <p>And I don’t blame you.  
    God, I don’t.  
    You’ve been through so much 
    maybe you need time, peace, air.  
    I just wish I knew what this distance really means.  
    Because it hurts, not knowing what we are anymore.</p>

    <p>I still care.  
    More than I can say without sounding like I’m begging for something.  
    And I’m not.  
    I’m not here to ask you to come back before you’re ready.  
    I just… I miss you.  
    Even the tired, quiet version of you.  
    Even the you that barely says a word.</p>

    <p>Maybe you don’t feel the break the same way I do.  
    Or maybe you do and that’s why it’s so quiet.</p>

    <p>Either way, if you ever wonder whether someone was willing to stay through the silence,  
    whether someone loved you enough to hold space while you found your way...</p>

    <p>The answer is yes.  
    I still do.  
    Even if we’re falling apart quietly.</p>

    <p>Take care of yourself.  
    I’ll be here.</p>
