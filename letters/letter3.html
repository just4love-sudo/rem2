    <h1>Does it still feel heavy on your heart?</h1>
    <p>
Sabrina,

I remember that night.
The one where the world fell apart
not because of thunder or war,
but because of the truth you learned.
The truth he made you carry.

The cheater.
The one who wore your love like a costume,
then left it wrinkled on the floor.
The things you found out that day…
they weren’t just facts.
They were knives.

I heard it in your voice
the way it cracked not from weakness,
but from holding in everything
for far too long.
You didn't just cry that night.
You collapsed.
And somehow, still stood.

You learned things that no one should ever have to learn.
That trust can lie.
That love, when given to the wrong hands,
can rot.
And that even someone you gave your everything to
can throw it away like it meant nothing.

But it did mean something.
It still does.

I saw your heart that night.
Shaking.
Bruised.
But still beating.

You tried to act like you were fine.
You always do.
But I knew you weren’t.
I could hear it in your silence
it was loud.

And I wish I could go back.
Take it all away.
I wish he never got to touch your heart,
never got to make you feel small
or unwanted
or not enough.

Because, Sabrina
you are so much more than enough.
You are more than the hurt he gave you.
More than the pain you carry quietly.
More than the girl who cried that night.

You are someone I look at and see fire,
even when all you feel is ash.

And on that night, when you cried,
I didn’t pity you.
I didn’t see someone broken.
I saw someone real.
Someone strong.
Someone worth loving in all the ways he never could.

And I still do.
