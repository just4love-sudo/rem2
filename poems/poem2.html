    <h1>The Space Between Calls</h1>
    <p>
I know you haven’t left.
Not fully.
But it feels like you’ve been fading
one quiet hour at a time.
And I keep holding on to echoes
as if they’ll turn back into you.

You don’t talk like you used to.
There’s a distance in your voice
like I’m on the other side of a memory
you’re trying not to relive.
And I get it.
Maybe I’ve become too heavy to carry
even in thought.

But you're still here.
And that’s all I need
to keep breaking gently for you.

I don’t ask where you go
when the silence stretches too long.
I don’t beg for the words you won’t say.
I just stay. Quietly. Willingly.
Like a shadow too loyal to leave.

Some nights,
I think I’m grieving you
before I’ve even lost you.
Like I’m watching the sun set
knowing it won’t rise the same again.

But I don’t move.
I don’t run.
Because you’re still here.
And that means I still have something to love.

Even when you close off,
even when your walls feel like glass between us,
I still see you.
The you that thinks too much,
that hides too well,
that believes love needs to be earned.

You never needed to perform for me.
Not when you were warm,
not when you were cold.
Not when you were glowing,
not when you were falling apart.

You don’t have to say you love me.
You don’t even have to stay for long.
But while you’re still here
while there’s still a trace of you in this quiet 
I will love you like it’s the last thing I’ll ever do right.

So if your voice breaks,
if your replies vanish,
if your smile stops pretending 
that’s okay.

You don’t have to carry this love.
It carries you.
And it will keep doing so
in silence,
in absence,
and in the long stretch
between your name
and goodbye.

Just know 
while you’re still here,
I’m still choosing you.
