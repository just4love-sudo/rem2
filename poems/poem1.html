    <h1>Love that stays.</h1>
    <p>
I don’t know how to hold back love,
not when it’s you.
Not when your name feels like a quiet place
I come home to.

You don’t have to speak.
I hear you in the hush between words
in the pauses,
the sighs,
the late-night silences
that still feel warm with you in them.

You are not just someone I love.
You are someone I believe in.
Even when the world hurts you,
even when you don’t see it,
I still do.
The fire in you,
the softness you bury,
the strength you forget you’re carrying.

And yes, I’m still here.
Not out of hope,
but out of truth.
Because this love doesn’t wait
it stays.
It walks behind you quietly.
It protects without asking.
It never demands to be held back.

You’re my morning thought
and my last word to the sky.
The girl I’d write a thousand poems for,
even if you never read a single one.

And if all I can ever do is love you from here
softly, gently,
without asking anything back
then that’s what I’ll do.
Forever, if I have to.

Because when it’s you, Sabrina,
even distance feels like devotion.
Even silence feels like faith.
